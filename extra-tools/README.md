## Extra-Tools
Here I will try to adapt some of my mini-projects of a masters subject (Information Retrival) that can provide tools that using the pubsub middleware can provide addicional features to the user and enrich system itself.
### Status
- Scraper: Thought for both protocols. In this scenario, one peer of IPFS may want to supply crawling service to other peers of IPFS with the objective of providing syntesised information and data from real-time events and news from the web. [State: Prototype]

- File Updating: Thought for FastDelivery because it is unmakeable with ScoutSubs. Some publishers may want to publish certain files at IPFS and then want to provide updates to interested peers. [State: Brainstorm]

- Self-Classified events: Thought for ScoutSubs. When we have a open system where publishers may clickbait their events' predicates, we may construct a text classifier to automatically attribute a predicate to a certain event message. Still to make this work we would need to have some backlist of peers which we detected did not altered the outcome or having a different method to validate the event classification. [State: Draft]
